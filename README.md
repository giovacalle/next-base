## Branches

All branches are derived from the `base` branch: the idea is to divide the various topics by individual branch, and then merge all the features of the other branches into `main`.

Right now you are in `with-radix/shadcn`: UI components, icons, fonts

## More about this branch

Here we extends tailwind configuration with a random palette generator (thanks to [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/visualizer/dcdcdd-c5c3c6-46494c-4c5c68-1985a1) ‚ú®), and add 2 utilities: `tailwind-animate` (for animations) and a custom one to hide scrollbars.
In addition, we wrap the configuration with `tailwind-variants/transformer` because we want to use the superpowers of `tailwind-variants` that allow us to define responsive variants (based on tailwind breakpoints).

We also replace `lucide-react` (that comes with `shadcn` components) with `@iconify/react`, because we like the multi-repos approach of `iconify` and its implementation of icons.

#### Why we are using `tailwind-variants` ?

`tailwind-variants` is a plugin built on top of `class-variance-authority` and provides some features like:

- [slots](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/docs/slots)
- [responsive variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/docs/variants#responsive-variants)

So, when we import `shadcn`components, we replaced the default `class-variance-authority` with `tailwind-variants`.

#### Why not use `shadcn CLI` ?

We are aware of fantastic [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) that generates all the components and blocks for us, but we want to keep the implementation more flexible and modular, without all the boilerplate code.
